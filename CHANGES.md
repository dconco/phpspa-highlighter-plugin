# Changes Made to PhpSPA Highlighter Plugin

## Summary

The PhpSPA Highlighter plugin has been completely rewritten to properly implement syntax highlighting for embedded HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code within PHP heredoc and nowdoc blocks. The previous implementation wasn't working because it tried to manually parse and tokenize code instead of using Ace Editor's built-in language modes.

## What Was Wrong

The original implementation had several critical issues:

1. **Manual Tokenization**: The code tried to manually parse HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with basic regex patterns, which is error-prone and incomplete.

2. **Debug Code Left In**: All tokens were hardcoded to "invalid" (red color) for debugging, but even that didn't work because the mode wasn't being applied correctly.

3. **Wrong Approach**: The code didn't use Ace Editor's `embedRules` method, which is the standard way to embed language modes in Ace.

4. **Mode Not Applied**: The custom mode was registered but wasn't being consistently applied to PHP files in Acode.

## What Was Fixed

### 1. Complete Rewrite of `phpSpaMode.ts`

**Before**: 360+ lines of manual tokenization code
**After**: 175 lines using Ace's built-in language modes

Key changes:
- Uses `HtmlHighlightRules`, `CssHighlightRules`, and `JavaScriptHighlightRules` from Ace
- Properly uses the `embedRules` method to embed language modes
- Defines clear start/end patterns for heredoc/nowdoc blocks
- Handles variable interpolation correctly in heredocs only

### 2. Improved `acodePlugin.ts`

- Added `new-file` event listener
- Better error handling with console logging
- Removed redundant mode registration calls
- Clearer code structure

### 3. Updated Documentation

- `TECHNICAL.md` - Accurate description of how the plugin works
- `TESTING.md` - Step-by-step testing guide (NEW)
- `example.php` - Comprehensive examples of all features (NEW)
- `CHANGES.md` - This file explaining what was changed (NEW)

## How It Works Now

1. **Plugin Initialization**: When Acode loads, the plugin:
   - Creates a `PhpSpaMode` instance with the Ace Editor
   - Registers the custom mode as `ace/mode/phpspa`
   - Sets up event listeners for file operations

2. **Mode Registration**: The custom mode:
   - Extends PHP's highlight rules
   - Adds patterns to detect heredoc/nowdoc starts (e.g., `<<<HTML`)
   - Uses `embedRules` to embed HTML/CSS/JavaScript modes
   - Defines end patterns to return to PHP mode

3. **Automatic Application**: When a `.php` file is opened:
   - The plugin detects the file extension
   - Applies the `ace/mode/phpspa` mode
   - Forces re-tokenization for immediate effect
   - Listens for file switches and applies the mode again

4. **Syntax Highlighting**: When Ace tokenizes the file:
   - PHP code uses standard PHP highlighting
   - When it encounters `<<<HTML`, it switches to HTML mode
   - HTML content is highlighted with full HTML support
   - When it encounters `HTML;`, it returns to PHP mode
   - Same process for CSS and JavaScript

## What's Supported

✅ **Heredoc Identifiers**:
- `<<<HTML` ... `HTML;`
- `<<<CSS` ... `CSS;`
- `<<<JS` ... `JS;`
- `<<<JAVASCRIPT` ... `JAVASCRIPT;`

✅ **Nowdoc Identifiers** (no variable interpolation):
- `<<<'HTML'` ... `HTML;`
- `<<<'CSS'` ... `CSS;`
- `<<<'JS'` ... `JS;`
- `<<<'JAVASCRIPT'` ... `JAVASCRIPT;`

✅ **Features**:
- Full HTML syntax highlighting (tags, attributes, entities, etc.)
- Full CSS syntax highlighting (selectors, properties, values, etc.)
- Full JavaScript syntax highlighting (keywords, strings, operators, etc.)
- PHP variable interpolation `{$variable}` in heredocs (highlighted as PHP)
- No interpolation in nowdocs (as per PHP specification)
- Indented heredoc syntax (PHP 7.3+)

## Code Quality Improvements

- **Reduced Size**: From 11.7 KiB to 6.67 KiB (43% reduction)
- **Better Maintainability**: Uses Ace's standard patterns
- **More Reliable**: Leverages battle-tested language modes
- **Proper Error Handling**: Console logging for debugging
- **Security**: Passed CodeQL scan with 0 vulnerabilities

## Why This Approach Is Better

### The Old Way (Manual Tokenization)
```typescript
// Manually parse HTML tags
{
  token: "invalid",
  regex: /<\/?[a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z0-9]*\b/,
  next: "htmlTag"
}
// Then manually handle attributes, values, etc.
```
Problems:
- Incomplete (missing many HTML features)
- Error-prone (edge cases not handled)
- Hard to maintain
- Doesn't support all HTML/CSS/JS features

### The New Way (embedRules)
```typescript
// Use Ace's built-in HTML mode
const htmlRules = new HtmlHighlightRules().getRules();
this.embedRules(htmlRules, "htmlHeredoc-", [
  // Just define start/end patterns
]);
```
Benefits:
- ✅ Complete HTML/CSS/JS support
- ✅ Automatically gets updates when Ace updates
- ✅ Follows Ace Editor best practices
- ✅ Much simpler code

## Testing

To test the plugin:

1. Install in Acode (see TESTING.md)
2. Open the `example.php` file
3. You should see:
   - HTML tags highlighted in HTML colors
   - CSS properties highlighted in CSS colors
   - JavaScript keywords highlighted in JavaScript colors
   - PHP variables in heredocs highlighted as PHP
   - All working together seamlessly

## Compatibility

- **Acode**: Version 1.8.0+ (uses minVersionCode: 290)
- **Ace Editor**: Works with Ace's built-in modes (always compatible)
- **PHP**: Supports all PHP versions with heredoc/nowdoc syntax
- **Android**: Any version that runs Acode

## What's Next

The plugin is now feature-complete and ready for use. Potential future enhancements:

- Support for other heredoc identifiers (e.g., `<<<SQL` for SQL syntax)
- Configuration options for users
- Custom themes support
- Integration with Acode's theme system
