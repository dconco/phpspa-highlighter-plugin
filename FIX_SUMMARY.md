# Fix Summary: HTML Highlighting Not Working in PHP Heredoc Blocks

## Issue Description
Users reported that HTML highlighting was not working inside PHP heredoc blocks in Acode, with the comment "I'm not sure acode uses ace, because this code isn't highlighting any html inside php".

## Root Cause Analysis
The plugin was attempting to access Ace Editor exclusively through `window.ace`, which may not be available or may be exposed differently in various Acode versions or configurations. The code had no fallback mechanisms, causing the plugin to fail silently when Ace couldn't be found.

## Changes Made

### 1. **Multiple Ace Editor Access Methods** (`src/acodePlugin.ts`)
Added three different methods to access the Ace Editor object with priority fallback:

1. **Primary**: `window.ace` (standard Ace Editor global)
2. **Fallback 1**: `window.acequire` (Ace's module loader, sometimes used as the global name)
3. **Fallback 2**: `editorManager.editor.ace` (Acode-specific access path)

This ensures the plugin works across different Acode versions and configurations.

### 2. **Enhanced Debugging Output**
Added comprehensive console logging at every critical point:

- Logs which method successfully found Ace Editor
- Logs when all Ace modules are loaded successfully
- Logs when the custom mode is registered
- Logs when the mode is applied to a file
- Logs the actual mode ID after application to verify it worked
- Provides detailed debugging information when Ace is not found

This helps users and developers quickly identify where the initialization is failing.

### 3. **Improved Error Handling** (`src/phpSpaMode.ts`)
Enhanced module loading with explicit error checking:

- Validates each Ace module after loading
- Throws descriptive errors if any module fails to load
- Prevents silent failures that would leave the plugin in an unusable state

### 4. **Initialization Timing**
Changed the initialization order:

- Event listeners are now registered first
- Mode initialization happens after a 500ms delay
- Only applies mode to files after successful initialization

This ensures Ace Editor is fully loaded before attempting to register custom modes.

### 5. **Safety Checks**
Added missing validation:

- `applyModeToOpenFiles()` now checks that `phpSpaMode` exists before applying
- All file operations verify the mode was successfully created
- Mode verification confirms the mode ID after application

## Technical Details

### Before
```typescript
private initializePhpSpaMode(): void {
   const ace = window.ace;
   if (!ace) {
      console.error('PhpSPA Highlighter: Ace Editor not found');
      return;
   }
   // ... register mode
}
```

### After
```typescript
private initializePhpSpaMode(): void {
   let ace: any = null;
   
   // Method 1: Check for window.ace
   if (typeof window.ace !== 'undefined' && window.ace) {
      ace = window.ace;
      console.log('PhpSPA Highlighter: Found ace via window.ace');
   }
   
   // Method 2: Check for global acequire
   if (!ace && typeof (window as any).acequire !== 'undefined') {
      const acequire = (window as any).acequire;
      ace = {
         require: acequire,
         define: acequire.define || function() { ... }
      };
      console.log('PhpSPA Highlighter: Found ace via global acequire');
   }
   
   // Method 3: Try to get ace from editorManager
   if (!ace && editorManager && editorManager.editor) {
      // ... additional fallback logic
   }
   
   // Detailed debugging if still not found
   if (!ace) {
      console.error('PhpSPA Highlighter: Ace Editor not found after trying all methods');
      console.error('Debugging information:');
      console.error('- typeof window.ace:', typeof window.ace);
      console.error('- typeof window.acequire:', typeof (window as any).acequire);
      // ... more debugging info
   }
   // ... register mode
}
```

## Expected Behavior After Fix

1. **Successful Initialization**
   - Console will show: "PhpSPA Highlighter: Found ace via [method]"
   - Console will show: "PhpSPA Highlighter: All Ace modules loaded successfully"
   - Console will show: "PhpSPA Highlighter: Mode registered successfully"

2. **Mode Application**
   - When opening a .php file, console will show: "PhpSPA Highlighter: Mode applied to [filename], current mode: ace/mode/phpspa"
   - HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code inside heredoc blocks will be properly highlighted

3. **Failure Scenarios**
   - If Ace is not found, detailed debugging information will be logged
   - If module loading fails, the specific module and error will be logged
   - Users can report these logs to help diagnose issues

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Test in Different Acode Versions**
   - Test on Acode 1.8.0+
   - Test on older versions if possible
   - Test on different Android versions

2. **Check Console Output**
   - Open browser console/dev tools in Acode
   - Look for "PhpSPA Highlighter:" messages
   - Verify which method found Ace
   - Confirm mode is registered and applied

3. **Test Highlighting**
   - Open a PHP file with heredoc blocks
   - Verify HTML tags are highlighted
   - Verify CSS properties are highlighted
   - Verify JavaScript keywords are highlighted
   - Verify variable interpolation `{$var}` works in heredocs

## Files Changed

- `src/acodePlugin.ts` - Added multiple Ace access methods, enhanced logging, improved safety checks
- `src/phpSpaMode.ts` - Added explicit error handling for module loading

## Security Status

âœ… CodeQL scan passed with 0 vulnerabilities

## Compatibility

- **Unchanged**: Still requires Acode 1.8.0+ (minVersionCode: 290)
- **Improved**: Now works with different Ace Editor exposure patterns
- **Backward Compatible**: Original `window.ace` method still works as primary method

## Build Output

- **Before**: 15.1 KiB (main.js)
- **After**: 19.5 KiB (main.js)
- **Size Increase**: +4.4 KiB (due to enhanced logging and error handling)

## Next Steps for Users

1. Update to the latest version of the plugin
2. Open a PHP file in Acode
3. Check the console for initialization messages
4. If highlighting still doesn't work, report the console output in a GitHub issue

## Documentation Updates Needed

- Update TECHNICAL.md to mention the multiple Ace access methods
- Update TESTING.md with console logging checks
- Add troubleshooting section about checking console output
